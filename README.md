https://github.com/farukalampro/helmet-segmentation-using-yolov8/assets/92469073/89c8187b-7e74-4c94-a6d9-bfbf7f033f36

## Overview

This project utilizes the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to perform helmet segmentation in images or videos. The goal is to identify and segment helmets within the input data, which can be valuable for safety applications, such as industrial settings or sports.

### Prerequisites

List the prerequisites for running your project. Include items like software dependencies, hardware requirements, and any data or models that need to be downloaded or prepared.

Example:
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended)
- Helmet segmentation dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset))

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project, including any necessary code dependencies or configuration steps.

Example:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/helmet-segmentation-using-yolov8.git`
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights (link here) and place them in the `weights/` directory.
